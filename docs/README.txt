ogwarts Analytica is a mobile app, which aims to raise awareness about data privacy and the dangers of its misuse among social media users. The app mainly consists of a Harry Potter themed personality test, which shows by example how ordinary quizzes people take on social media inconspicuously collect personal data as well as how readily they sometimes share it with others. Moreover, the app points out the fact that people don't always know the intentions behind social media quizzes, but do always have a choice whether to reveal their personal information or not. After completing the quiz, the user gets a detailed explanation of the what has been happening in the personality test and receives recommendations on data privacy and data protection.
